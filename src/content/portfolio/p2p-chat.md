## Requirements
This is a personal project of mine, I decided to do develop this because I wanted to evolve my skills in `Rust` and also learn about web fundamentals (cryptography, transport protocols, etc.) and distributed systems.

## What I did
I used a library named `libp2p` that provides the building blocks of a peer-to-peer network. I glued them together and developed my own system. The chat is encrypted, distributed, and decentralized, it also supports sending files between peers.
