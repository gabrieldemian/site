## About
This project was the frontend of a web3 company focused in gaming in Ethereum.

## Requirements

I needed to refactor the website from Vue to React, code complex animations from the design team, connect users to their Ethereum wallets and protect routes.

## What I did

I did the initial version of the website in:
- React
- Typescript
- Framer Motion
- Ethers

I decided that I needed an animation library for the animations, because there were just too complex to be hand-crafted, I used `framer-motion`.

I developed my own libraries to handle Ethereum connections, authentication, transactions, etc.
