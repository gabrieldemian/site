## Letter of recommendation

My work earned me a [letter of recommendation](https://glombardo.dev/recommendation-letter.pdf).

## About

They are a "web3-NFT-comics-gaming" company and needed a single place for the users to access these features.

This was a very important project for *Pixel Vault* for which they trusted me to build it alone, from scratch.

## Requirements

The project was very ambitious, some of the requirements:

- Handle smart contracts
- Handle wallet connections
- Host NFT drops
- Animations
- Complex design system
- Render Comic books
- Render *Unity* games

## Stack

I chose the following tech stack:

- Tailwindcss
- React with Typescript
- Framer motion
- Ethers
- Wagmi hooks

At first I built my own libraries to handle everything Ethereum: RPC calls, transactions, wallets, etc. Later on I moved some of the code to `wagmi-hooks`.
