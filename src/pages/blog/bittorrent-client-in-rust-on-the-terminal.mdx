The BitTorrent protocol is quite old, it was released in 2001, and Bitcoin was released in 2009.
Back then, the internet was mostly decentralized (especially in the 90s).
People owned their data, hosted their own websites and servers, etc.

Most of the web from those days has died. But these two protocols are survivors of the
war of the modern internet. They survived, because they are, above everything, _decentralized_.

## The client

So, why did I built another BitTorrent client? We already have BitTorrent, uTorrent, and others.
The problem is that those clients are just not good anymore. They are infested with ADs
(from the big tech), malware, the download rate is slowed down on purpose. You have to
pay if you want to get rid of these. Not good.

Of course, not all clients are like that, and I have used some good clients (like [transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/)).
But what saddened me is that I couldn't find a client that has support for a terminal UI,
and since I use the terminal all of the time on the computer, I want everything on the terminal.

## Results

I have built the client in Rust, a safe and fast language. It's MIT license and ADs free,
multi-platform, and multi-threaded. The performance is very good, similar to the other
clients. (that don't slow down your download rate on purpose).

The protocol is very rich and there are lots of plugins and features to complement.
I have added supported for magnet links and UDP connections to trackers.

Some nice-to-haves in the future would be: [DHT](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html),
[PEX](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0011.html), among others. But I'm doing this
by myself, so I don't have a lot of free time to do all of this.

You can access the client [here](https://github.com/gabrieldemian/Vincenzo).
